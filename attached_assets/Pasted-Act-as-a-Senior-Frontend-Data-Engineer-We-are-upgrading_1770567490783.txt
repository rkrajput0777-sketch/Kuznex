Act as a Senior Frontend & Data Engineer. We are upgrading the Kuznex Dashboard with "Portfolio Analytics" and a "3D UI Experience".

### 1. DATABASE UPDATES (Supabase)
- **New Table daily_snapshots:**
  - Columns: id, user_id, date (YYYY-MM-DD), total_balance_usdt, created_at.
Logic:c:** Create a Scheduled Job (Cron) that runs at 00:00 UTC every day to save every user's current balance into this table. This is the "Yesterday's Balance" reference.

- **Modify users table (or a View):**
  - Add computed fields/aggregates:
    - total_deposited: Sum of all 'completed' deposits.
    - total_withdrawn: Sum of all 'completed' withdrawals.

### 2. BACKEND LOGIC (The Calculation Engine)

    - Current Balance - Balance from daily_snapshots (Yesterday).
    - If no snapshot exists (new user), use 0.
    - Return change_amount (e.g., +$50) and change_percentage (e.g., +2.5%).

### 5. EXECUTION
- Ensure the logic handles "Division by Zero" (if balance was 0 yesterday).
- The 3D Card should look premium (Cyberpunk/Fintech style).
