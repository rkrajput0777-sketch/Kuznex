Act as a Senior Full-Stack Blockchain Developer. Refactor the existing "Kuznex" project completely based on these new requirements.

### 1. VISUAL OVERHAUL (White Theme & Trust)
- Theme: Change the entire UI from Dark Mode to a Professional White/Light Theme.
  - Background: White (#ffffff) and Light Gray (#f3f4f6).
  - Text: Dark Slate (#1e293b) for headings, Gray (#64748b) for subtext.
  - Accents: Use a Trustworthy Green (#10b981) for "Buy/Profit" and Primary Buttons.
- Hero Section: Remove the "Stats Grid" ($50M Volume, Active Traders, etc.). Keep it clean with just the Headline: "Kuznex: Institutional-Grade Crypto OTC & Swap Desk."
- Compliance Section: Update the "Licensed Entity" card.
  - REMOVE: All specific License Numbers, CIN numbers, and IDs.
  - KEEP: Generic text like "Compliant with Indian Companies Act", "FIU-IND Reporting Standards", and "KYC/AML Protocols".

### 2. CORE FUNCTIONALITY (The "Real" Logic)
Build a functional Dashboard for logged-in users with these features:

A. Wallet System (PostgreSQL Schema):
- Create a UserWallet table tracking balances for: INR, USDT, BTC, ETH, BNB.
- Balances should be stored as Decimals.

B. Deposit System (Crypto - Real Logic):
- UI: Show a QR Code and a Wallet Address (I will provide the address in code constants).
- Network: Support BSC (BEP20) and Polygon (MATIC) initially for low fees.
- Logic: Add a button "I Have Sent Funds". When clicked, use a block explorer API (like BscScan API free tier) to check if the user's transaction has hit the Admin Wallet. If confirmed, update the User's Database Balance instantly.

C. Instant Swap Engine (Any-to-Any):
- UI: A simple "Convert" box (Like Binance Convert).
- Price Feed: Fetch REAL-TIME prices using coingecko-api or Binance Public API.
- Logic:
  1. User selects "Swap USDT to BTC".
  2. Fetch Live Rate -> Apply 1% Spread (Profit).
  3. Check Database Balance -> Deduct USDT -> Add BTC (Internal Ledger Update).
  4. Record transaction in SwapHistory.

D. INR On/Off Ramp (Manual Queue):
- Deposit INR: Show Admin Bank Details. User uploads "UTR/Reference No". Status set to "Pending". Admin (Me) will manually approve from DB.
- Withdraw INR: User enters their Bank Details. Funds deducted from DB, status "Pending". Admin manually sends money.

### 3. TECH STACK & LIBRARIES
- Frontend: Next.js + Tailwind CSS.
- Icons: Lucide-React.
- Blockchain Utils: ethers.js (for address validation), axios (for API calls).
- Charts: Lightweight-charts (TradingView) for a simple live price graph on the Swap page.

### 4. SPECIFIC INSTRUCTION
- Create a config file constants.js where I can easily paste my Admin Wallet Addresses (Metamask) later.
- Do not use fake data. If the API fails, show "Price loading...".
