Act as a Senior Frontend & Backend Developer. We are fixing Branding, Logic, and UI issues for "Kuznex Exchange".

### 1. BRANDING: REMOVE "BINANCE" & ADD "KUZNEX" (Critical)
The TradingView widget currently shows "BINANCE:BTCUSDT" which looks unprofessional.
Fix Implementation:
- In the TradingView Widget configuration, set these properties to TRUE:
  - hide_top_toolbar: true (This hides the search bar and the "Binance" logo/text).
  - hide_legend: true (Cleans up the chart).
  - allow_symbol_change: false (Prevent users from searching Binance pairs directly inside the widget).
- Custom Header:
  - Above the Widget, create your OWN Custom Header div.
  - Content: Display "Kuznex Pro Chart  |  [Current_Pair_Name]  |  Live"
  - Style: Make it look like a professional exchange header.
  - This tricks the user into thinking the data is native to Kuznex.

### 2. FIX FIAT BUY LOGIC (Stop "Insufficient Balance" Error)
- Current Bug: When a user clicks "Buy USDT" with INR, the system checks their wallet balance and says "Insufficient INR".
- Correct Logic:
  - Buying USDT is an External Deposit. Users send money from THEIR Bank to OUR Bank.
  - Action: Remove the check if (user.balance < amount).
  - New Flow:
    1. User enters Amount (e.g., 10,000 INR).
    2. Show Admin Bank Details / UPI ID.
    3. User makes payment externally.
    4. User enters UTR Number in a form and submits.
    5. Save as pending transaction.

### 3. DATABASE & ADMIN REPAIRS
- Missing Columns: Ensure the fiat_transactions table has:
  - utr_number (text), screenshot (text), admin_reply (text).
- Missing Admin Page: Create /admin/fiat-approvals.
  - Buy Tab: List Pending UTRs -> Admin checks Bank -> Click "Approve" -> Add USDT to User.
  - Sell Tab: List Pending Withers -> Admin sends Cash -> Click "Complete" -> Deduct USDT.

### 4. INJECT 300+ TRADING PAIRS
- The current list is too small.
- Create a hardcoded JSON file pairs.js with Top 300 Crypto Pairs (BTC, ETH, SOL, PEPE, SHIB, DOGE, XRP, ADA, MATIC, DOT, etc.).
- Ensure the Search Bar in the Trading Page filters through this big list efficiently.
- When a user clicks a pair (e.g., "PEPE/USDT"), update the Chart symbol to BINANCE:PEPEUSDT (but keep the toolbar hidden so they don't see "Binance").

### 5. UI CLEANUP
- Separate Pages:
  - /fiat -> Only for INR Deposit/Withdraw (Bank Transfer).
  - /wallet -> Only for Crypto Deposit/Withdraw (QR Code).
- Navigation: Update the Header Menu to show these as separate options.
